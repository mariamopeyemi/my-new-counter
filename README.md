# my-new-counter

Built using javascript and css

It has a counter minimum value of 0 and the maximum value of 50. 

It is responsive on both mobile and desktop. 

Upon click of the add count button, there is an increment in value by one and upon click of lower count there is a decrement in value by one.

Well, I still intend to convert this to a countdown app as I have an initail counter like this. Then I would work on the design too
